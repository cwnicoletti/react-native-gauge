Contributing
============

Pull requests are super awesome, if you have the time, I'd really love if you could create a pull request for react-native-gauge!

Here are some ways you can contribute:

*   by reporting bugs
*   by suggesting new features
*   by writing or editing documentation
*   by writing code (no patch is too small: fix typos, add comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace)
*   by refactoring code
*   by closing [issues](https://github.com/cwnicoletti/react-native-gauge/issues)

Submitting an Issue
-------------------

*   We use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/cwnicoletti/react-native-gauge/issues) to track bugs and features.
*   Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't already been submitted.

Cleaning up issues
------------------

*   Issues that have no response from the submitter will be closed after 30 days.
*   Issues will be closed once they're assumed to be fixed or answered. If the maintainer is wrong, it can be opened again.
